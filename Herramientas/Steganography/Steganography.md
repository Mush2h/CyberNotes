# Steganography

## Introduction

Steganography is the practice of hiding information within another file, message, or object, in such a way that its existence goes unnoticed. Its name comes from the Greek words "steganos" (covered) and "graphos" (writing), and it differs from cryptography in that it not only protects the content of the message but also its very existence.

### Types of Steganography:
- Text Steganography: Hides messages in texts using techniques such as the use of spaces, specific letters, or patterns in words.
- Image Steganography: Uses digital images to embed data by manipulating pixels or least significant bits (LSB).
- Audio and Video Steganography: Conceals information in multimedia files through imperceptible modifications.
- Protocol Steganography: Embeds data in communication protocols such as TCP/IP.
