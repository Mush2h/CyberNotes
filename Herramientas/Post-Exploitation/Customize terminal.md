# Custumize Terminal

After accessing a Linux system with a Netcat reverse shell, we have a new reverse shell but in a different format than we're used to.

## Loading a Pseudo-Console on the System

We have two ways to do this:

1. Using script:
```shell
script /dev/null -c bash
```

2. Using Python (recommended to use whereis python first to check available versions):

```shell
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

## Configuring Environment Variables

Next, press Ctrl+Z to background our session. Then apply these commands:
```shell
stty raw -echo;fg
reset xterm
``` 

After entering the first command, it's normal not to see fg as you type. This command will return us to the Netcat session. The reset command reconfigures our session, often asking what type of terminal we want to use.

If it asks for terminal type, enter xterm. Whether it asks or not, subsequently apply these commands:

```shell
export TERM=xterm
export SHELL=bash`
```

## Resizing the Terminal (Optional)

To correctly resize the terminal (useful for editors like nano), it's best to maximize your terminal window.
Open another terminal on your system with the same size and apply:
```shell
stty -a
```
You'll see output like:

```shell
speed 38400 baud; rows 44; columns 190; line = 0;
```

Note the rows and columns, then apply these dimensions to the previous terminal:

```shell
stty rows 44 columns 190
```

This ensures proper terminal dimensions for better usability.
